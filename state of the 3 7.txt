1. In `testFutureCoordinatorFailure`, 1 in recovery adds timers and they don't
   time out (on 2 which is down at the time), and so it doesn't keep wheeling
   and dealing.

2. It seems like maybe there are issues with the ObjectConnections because a
   few other tests are broken, all of which were passing in the last commit.
